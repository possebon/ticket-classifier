# Ticket Classifier

Nowadays, the complexity of IT infrastructure grows at the same proportion as
new technology emerges. Companies have different environments to manage, on-premises,
cloud, production, development, and quality assurance. Each environment needs different
specialists to minimize the impact of any incident; support tickets must be forwarded to the
correct teams from the moment the tickets are opened, removing the need for reclassification
or even redirecting because the ticket was assigned to the wrong team. This work aims to
provide an incident classifier in Brazilian Portuguese having speech as input using general
automatic speech recognition (gASR) like Amazon Alexa and Google Home.
